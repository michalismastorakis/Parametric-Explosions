# Parametric-Explosions
This code uses a semi-analytic parametric model for stellar explosions and you can perform a parameter study with a custom grid resolution. It performs a population synthesis in each instance of parameter values and gets a remnant mass distribution. It has some functions that can analyse such distributions.
